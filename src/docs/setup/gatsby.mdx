## Configure your Gatsby Site

To set up your Gatsby website, you might need to edit the configuration files located at the root of your project.

- ✏️✏️✏️ `.env` - basic **mandatory** configuration
- ✏️✏️ `config.js` - further configuration, general features
- ✏️✏️ `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration, here you can change colors, fonts, sizes and all options of the [tailwind theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme)

## Setting up the `.env` File

Some crucial settings of your Gatsby website are set as environment variables. That means Gatsby will look for them in the `.env` file. The most important ones are:

- `GATSBY_WP_URL` - mandatory setting, the URL of the WordPress source website
- `GATSBY_SITE_URL` - mandatory for a published production website, the URL of your published Gatsby website

The easiest way to set up your `.env` file is to rename the existing `.env-sample` to `.env`. You will find the sample `.env-sample` file in the root of each starter.

```bash title=.env-sample
# rename this file to .env (or .env.development and .env.production)
# supply the values listed below
# make sure to uncomment the lines that you edit

# GATSBY_WP_URL=the_url_of_your_wordpress_website
# GATSBY_SITE_URL=the_url_to_your_published_gatsby_site
# GATSBY_MAILCHIMP_ENDPOINT=https://gmail.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u={your_value}&amp;id={your_id}
```

Alternatively, you can create two separate `.env` files `.env.development` and `.env.production`. Gatsby will use choose one of these depending on the environment you are in:

- if you run `gatsby develop`, you will be in the _development_ environment.
- if you run `gatsby build` or `gatsby serve`, then you will be in the _production_ environment.

### `GATSBY_WP_URL`

Uncomment the `GATSBY_WP_URL` line and replace the `the_url_of_your_wordpress_website` with the URL of your WP website, for example:

```bash title=.env
GATSBY_WP_URL=https://wp.example.com
```

### `GATSBY_SITE_URL`

Uncomment the `GATSBY_SITE_URL` line and replace the `the_url_to_your_published_gatsby_site` with the URL of your WP website, for example:

```bash title=.env
GATSBY_WP_URL=https://gatsby.example.com
```

### `GATSBY_MAILCHIMP_ENDPOINT`

You can subscribe new email addresses to a Mailchimp email list with our Newsletter widget.
To activate Mailchimp, assign your Mailchimp list endpoint URL to the environmental variable `GATSBY_MAILCHIMP_ENDPOINT`

Under the hood, our themes use [`gatsby-mailchimp-plugin`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mailchimp) for the MailChimp subscriptions.
Check [the plugin documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mailchimp/#mailchimp-endpoint) for more information on how to locate your Mailchimp endpoint.

example:

```bash title=.env
GATSBY_MAILCHIMP_ENDPOINT=https://gmail.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=xxxyyyzzz&amp;id=xxyyzz
```

Things you should be aware of:

- `.env`, `.env.development` or `.env.production` are not checked into version control. If you need to check your `.env` file, you can remove it from the `.gitignore` file.
- All variables prefixed with GATSBY\_ will be made available to client-side code.
- You will have to make sure that your environment variables are available to the build tool (see the [Deployment section](/more/deployment)).
- After modifying the `.env` file, you will need to restart the server.
