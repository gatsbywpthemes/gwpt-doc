## Set Up Your Development Environment

To build your Gatsby website locally on your computer, you will need to set up your local machine. The official Gatsby documentation provides a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">step by step tutorial on how to set up your development environment.</a>  
Follow their tutorial and make sure to have `gatsby-cli` correctly installed.

## Installing your Gatsby starter

1. Unzip the starter of your choice.

   ```bash title=Starter structure copy=false
   ├── .babelrc
   ├── ✏️✏️✏️ .env-sample # rename to .env
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── ✏️✏️✏️ .npmrc-sample # rename to .npmrc
   ├── README.md
   ├── ✏️✏️ config.js
   ├── ✏️ configColors.js
   ├── ✏️ configSizes.js
   ├── ✏️ configTypography.js
   ├── gatsby-config.js
   ├── package.json
   ├── src
   │   ├── 🗂 @gatsbywpthemes
   │   └── 🗂 styles
   └── 🗂 static

   # ✏️✏️✏️ - you have to edit this file
   # ✏️✏️  - you will probably need to edit this file
   # ✏️   - you might want to edit this file
   ```

2. Open the `.nprmc` file and replace `YOUR-AUTH-TOKEN` string with the token you can find in your welcome mail.
3. Run `yarn` command from your starter directory. It will install all the dependencies.
4. Rename the `.env.sample` file as `.env`. In your `.env` file provide the url of your WordPress source website.
5. Run `gatsby develop` to start the development server.

## Configure your Gatsby Site

To set up your Gatsby website, you might need to edit the configuration files ( ✏️ ) located at the root of your project.

- ✏️✏️✏️ `.env` - basic **mandatory** configuration
- ✏️✏️ `config.js` - further configuration, general features
- ✏️ `configColors.js` - if you want to change the theme colors
- ✏️ `configSizes.js` - if you want to change some layout values (responsive breakpoints, container width, etc.)
- ✏️ `configTypography.js` - if you want to modify the typography settings (font family, heading sizes etc.)

## Setting Up the `.env` File

Some crucial settings of your Gatsby website are set as environment variables. That means Gatsby will look for them in the `.env` file. The most important ones are:

- `GATSBY_WP_URL` - mandatory setting, the URL of the WordPress source website
- `GATSBY_SITE_URL` - mandatory for a published production website, the URL of your published Gatsby website

The easiest way to set up your `.env` file is to rename the existing `.env-sample` to `.env`. You will find the sample `.env-sample` file in the root of each starter.

```sh title=.env-sample
# rename this file to .env (or .env.development and .env.production)
# supply the values listed below
# make sure to uncomment the lines that you edit

# GATSBY_WP_URL=the_url_of_your_wordpress_website
# GATSBY_SITE_URL=the_url_to_your_published_gatsby_site
# GATSBY_MAILCHIMP_ENDPOINT=https://gmail.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u={your_value}&amp;id={your_id}
```

Alternatively, you can create two separate `.env` files `.env.development` and `.env.production`. Gatsby will use choose one of these depending on the environment you are in:

- if you run `gatsby develop`, you will be in the _development_ environment.
- if you run `gatsby build` or `gatsby serve`, then you will be in the _production_ environment.

### `GATSBY_WP_URL`

Uncomment the `GATSBY_WP_URL` line and replace the `the_url_of_your_wordpress_website` with the URL of your WP website, for example:

```sh title=.env
GATSBY_WP_URL=https://wp.example.com
```

### `GATSBY_SITE_URL`

Uncomment the `GATSBY_SITE_URL` line and replace the `the_url_to_your_published_gatsby_site` with the URL of your WP website, for example:

```sh title=.env
GATSBY_WP_URL=https://gatsby.example.com
```

### `GATSBY_MAILCHIMP_ENDPOINT`

You can subscribe new email addresses to a Mailchimp email list with our Newsletter widget.  
To activate Mailchimp, assign your Mailchimp list endpoint URL to the environmental variable `GATSBY_MAILCHIMP_ENDPOINT`

Under the hood, our themes use [`gatsby-mailchimp-plugin`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mailchimp) for the MailChimp subscriptions.
Check [the plugin documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mailchimp/#mailchimp-endpoint) for more information on how to locate your Mailchimp endpoint.

example:

```sh title=.env
GATSBY_MAILCHIMP_ENDPOINT=https://gmail.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=xxxyyyzzz&amp;id=xxyyzz
```

Things you should be aware of:

- `.env`, `.env.development` or `.env.production` are not checked into version control. If you need to check your `.env` file, you can remove it from the `.gitignore` file.
- All variables prefixed with GATSBY\_ will be made available to client-side code.
- You will have to make sure that your environment variables are available to the build tool (e.g., Netlify).
- After modifying the `.env` file, you will need to restart the server.
