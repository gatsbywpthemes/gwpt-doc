Gatsby WP Themes join two distinct universes: WordPress and Gatsby. That means that you will have to configure your project on both ends.

Your WordPress website must be set up so that Gatsby can fetch and process its content. That is the first thing to be done, and that's what we are going to begin with in the [Setting up WordPress](/setup/wp) section.

If your WordPress website is already configured or you are going fetch some demo data from the pre-configured WordPress - skip directly to the [Configure your Gatsby](/setup/gatsby) part.
