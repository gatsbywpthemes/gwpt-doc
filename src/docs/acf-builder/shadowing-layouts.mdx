description: How to change your layouts html.

In order to change the HTML/jsx of your file you will need to use [shadowing](/more/shadowing).

In the Agency starter we have done it for ProjectsBlock.js.

These are the steps to follow:
- Go to nodes_modules/@gatsbywpthemes/gatsby-theme-acf-builder/src and copy the file that you need to modify.
- Paste it in src/@gatsbywpthemes/gatsby-theme-acf-builder
- correct the import path, for ex:
``` javascript title=src/@gatsbywpthemes/gatsby-theme-acf-builder/ProjectsBlock.js
import { HeadlineContent } from "./HeadlineContent";
//becomes
import { HeadlineContent } from "@gatsbywpthemes/gatsby-theme-acf-builder/src/HeadlineContent"
```
- Make the changes you need!
