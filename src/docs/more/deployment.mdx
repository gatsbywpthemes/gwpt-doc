[The Gatsby documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/deploying-and-hosting/) explains in details the deployment process. You will find there a variety of possibilities.  
You should definitely consider deploying on [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/), the cloud platform specifically built by Gatsby for the Gatsby framework.

Right below, we will describe step-by-step the deployment process on [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/) and [Netlify.](https://www.netlify.com/)

In both cases you need to have a remote repository for your project. Your repository can be private or public. We'll use GitHub here.

> âœ… Given that our starters require `yarn` to work, make sure to **have `yarn.lock`** in your starter's GitHub repository. The `yarn.lock` file is automatically added when you first install your dependencies with the `yarn ` command.

5. In the configuration screen, choose:
   - your branch to deploy - each time you push to this branch, your site will be rebuilt
   - the build command: `yarn build` (or `gatsby build`)
   - your publish directory: `public`
   - open the **Advanced build settings** panel to add your environment variables. Paste all the variables you set in your `.env` file as well as the secret auth token `GWPT_AUTH_TOKEN`.  
     Your build requires two environment variables `GWPT_AUTH_TOKEN` and `GATSBY_WP_URL`.
