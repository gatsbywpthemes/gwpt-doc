title: Shadowing
description: How to shadow components in our theme.
---

> The starters with the `-dev` suffix do not require shadowing. These starters do not use the theme from the npm package. Instead, the theme structure is replicated directly in the `src` folder. You can modify any of these files directly. This approach is recommended for **developers** who need to go much further with the customization.

To override (shadow) the components, you will need to place the files you need to override into `src/@gatsby-wp-theme/gatsby-theme-{your-theme}`. It's already there, you don't need to create it.

> If you want to learn about shadowing, [check this tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/shadowing/) from the Gatsby documentation.

## Example - Shadowing the footer content

Let's modify the footer text in the `base` starter.
The files structure in the `gatsby-theme-wp-base` theme is

```bash title=@gatsbywpthemes/gatsby-theme-wp-base highlight={7}
├── src
│   └── components
│       ├── archive
│       ├── comments
│       ├── footer
│       │   ├── Footer.js
│       │   ├── FooterContent.js # 👈 we will override this file
│       │   └── index.js
│       ├── header
│       ├── ....
└── ...
```

We will override the `FooterContent.js` file

```js title=@gatsbywpthemes/gatsby-theme-wp-base/src/components/footer/Footer.js
import React from "react"
import { Box, Link } from "@chakra-ui/react"

export const FooterContent = (props) => {
  return (
    <Box textAlign="center" {...props}>
      © {new Date().getFullYear()} | Built with{" "}
      <Link href="https://www.wpgraphql.com">WPGraphQL</Link> and{" "}
      <Link href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</Link>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

You need to add the `FooterContent.js` file in your starter's `src/@gatsbywpthemes/gatsby-theme-wp-base/components/footer`

Now, the structure or your starter should be as follows:

```bash title=starter-base highlight={10-11}
├── .env
├── ...
├── src
│   ├── @gatsbywpthemes
│   │   └── gatsby-theme-wp-base
│   │       ├── chakra
│   │       ├── utils
│   │       └── components
│   │           ├── Layout.js
│   │           └── 🆕 footer
│   │               └── 🆕 FooterContent.js
│   └── styles
└── ...
```

```js title=src/@gatsbywpthemes/gatsby-theme-wp-base/components/footer/Footer.js
import React from "react"
import { Box, Text } from "@chakra-ui/react"

export const FooterContent = (props) => {
  return (
    <Box textAlign="center" {...props}>
      Built with{" "}
      <Text as="span" role="img" aria-label="heart">
        ❤️
      </Text>{" "}
      by Gatsby WP Themes
    </Box>
  )
}
```

> In the development mode, you will have to **restart the development server** to see any changes after changing the file structure in your starter's `src` folder.
