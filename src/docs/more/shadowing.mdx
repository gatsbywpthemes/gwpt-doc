To override (shadow) the components, you will need to place the files you need to override into `src/@gatsby-wp-theme/gatsby-theme-{your-theme}`. This also work for plugins.
We are using this method to style the components from the gatsby-plugin-wpcf7, gatsby-theme-wp-comments and gatsby-theme-wp-search

> In the development mode, you will have to **restart the development server** to see any changes after changing the file structure in your starter's `src` folder.
