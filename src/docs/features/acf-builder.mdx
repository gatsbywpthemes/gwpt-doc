description: Using the ACF Builder.
---

Our new themes include the HeadlessWP-2.0 and HeadlessWP Custom Fields plugins which power a builder that is driven by @gatsbywpthemes/gatsby-theme-acf-builder on the Gatsby side and ACF Flexible Content on the WordPress side.
With the help of this builder, you can create nearly any kind of layout!

## configuration
You can choose where to use the builder and where to use the WordPress editor.

Go to Options and the back-office and select where you want to use it.

Even if it's unchecked it will appear in the WordPress back-office, but will be deactivated on the Gatsby side.
