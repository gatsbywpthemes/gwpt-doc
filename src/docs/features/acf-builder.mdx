description: Using the ACF Builder.
---

Our new themes include the HeadlessWP-2.0 and HeadlessWP Custom Fields plugins, which power a builder that is driven by @gatsbywpthemes/gatsby-theme-acf-builder on the Gatsby side and ACF Flexible Content on the WordPress side.
With the help of this builder, you can create nearly any kind of layout!

## configuration
You can choose where to use the builder and where to use the WordPress editor.

Go to Options and the back-office and select where you want to use it.

By default, it's activated on pages and projects and deactivated on posts.

Even if it's unchecked, it will appear in the WordPress back-office but will be deactivated on the Gatsby side.
