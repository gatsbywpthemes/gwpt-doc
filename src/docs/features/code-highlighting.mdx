title: Code Highlighting
description: How the code highlighting works and how you can configure it
---

We thought you might sometimes blog about code, and we added support for block code highlighting by default. Under the hood, we use [Prism](https://prismjs.com/).

## On the WordPress side

We recommend using [Code Syntax Block](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-syntax-block/) WordPress plugin for editing your code snippets in WordPress.

> Please note that only "Language" and "Show line numbers" WordPress settings are retained.

## Change theme

You can easily replace the default `twilight` theme by:

- coy,
- dark,
- funky,
- okaidia,
- solarizedlight,
- tomorrow.

To modify the theme, you will have to edit the `.babelrc` file (in the root of your starter).

```json title=.babelrc highlight={9} lineNumbers=true
{
  "presets": ["babel-preset-gatsby"],
  "plugins": [
    [
      "prismjs",
      {
        "languages": ["javascript", "css", "markup", "typescript"],
        "plugins": ["show-language"],
        "theme": "tomorrow",
        "css": true
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

You can also use any additional theme available in the [`prism-themes` repository](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes)

<div class="steps">

1. Install `prism-themes` in your starter

   ```bash
   # from your starter folder
   yarn add prism-themes
   ```

2. Deactivate the default theme in the `.babelrc` file

   ```json title=.babelrc highlight={9} lineNumbers=true
   {
     "presets": ["babel-preset-gatsby"],
     "plugins": [
       [
         "prismjs",
         {
           "languages": ["javascript", "css", "markup", "php"],
           "plugins": ["show-language"],
           // "theme": "twilight",
           "css": true
         }
       ]
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Add an additional theme to the `gatsby-browser.js` file in the root of your starter (you might need to create this file)

   ```js title=gatsby-browser.js
   import "prism-themes/themes/prism-duotone-forest.css"
   ```

</div>

## Configure languages

You might need support for more languages. By default we add support to JavaScript, HTML (markup), CSS, and PHP.
To modify the list of supported languages, you will need to edit the `.babelrc` (in the root of your starter).

In the following example, we removed the support for PHP and addded support for TypeScript (line 7).

```json title=.babelrc highlight={7} lineNumbers=true
{
  "presets": ["babel-preset-gatsby"],
  "plugins": [
    [
      "prismjs",
      {
        "languages": ["javascript", "css", "markup", "typescript"],
        "plugins": ["show-language"],
        "theme": "twilight",
        "css": true
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Add more options

You can add support to "line numbers" and "copy to clipboard" functionnality, by adding plugins to `prism`. By default, we add only `show-language`.

You will need to edit the `.babelrc` (in the root of your starter) - see line 8.

```json title=.babelrc highlight={8} lineNumbers=true
{
  "presets": ["babel-preset-gatsby"],
  "plugins": [
    [
      "prismjs",
      {
        "languages": ["javascript", "css", "markup", "typescript"],
        "plugins": ["show-language", "line-numbers", "copy-to-clipboard"],
        "theme": "twilight",
        "css": true
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

> Please note that in the .babelrc file you only enable support for the `line-numbers` plugin. The line numbers will be added only to the snippets with **"Show line numbers" activated in your WordPress code block.**

## Deactivate code highlighting

If you don't need code highlighting in your project and want to optimize your bundle size, you can deactivate it.

To do so, you will have to rename or remove the `ActivatePrism.js` file from your starter folder `src/@gatsbywpthemes/{theme-name}/utils`.

**Example:**

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .babelrc
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
# ...
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ @gatsbywpthemes
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ gatsby-theme-wp-base
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ chakra
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ utils
â”‚   â”‚           # renamed to ActivatePrism-old.js, you can also delete this file
â”‚   â”‚           â””â”€â”€ ðŸ”„ ActivatePrism-old.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles
â””â”€â”€ static
```
