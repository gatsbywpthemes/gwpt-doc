description: Setting up Contact Forms.
---

Our themes port the forms built with Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin directly to Gatsby. You create your contact forms, add them to the pages with a shortcode, and that's it.

You can find a [working form example](https://gatsbystarterbase.gatsbyjs.io/form-example/) with all supported fields in your starter demo `/form-example/`.

## Unsupported fields and features

- The `[acceptance]` field is not supported. It is deacivated in our Headless WP theme.  
  You can use the checkboxes (`[checkbox]` or `[checkbox*]`) instead:

  ```
  [checkbox*
  checkbox-208
  use_label_element
  "By checking this field, you agree to our Privacy Policy."]
  ```

- The **_ Make checkboxes exclusive_** feature for checkboxes is not supported.  
  You can use radio buttons (`[radio]`) instead.
