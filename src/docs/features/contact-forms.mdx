description: Setting Up Contact Forms.
---

Our themes port the forms built with Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin directly to Gatsby. You create your contact forms, add them to the pages with a shortcode, and that's it.

You can find a working form example with all supported fields in your starter demo `/form-example/`.

> The `[acceptance]` field is not supported. It is deacivated in our Headless WP theme.  
> You can use the checkboxes (`[checkbox]` or `[checkbox*]`) instead:
>
> ```
> [checkbox*
> checkbox-208
> use_label_element
> "By checking this field, you agree to our Privacy Policy."]
> ```

> The **_ Make checkboxes exclusive_** feature for checkboxes is not supported.  
> You can use radio buttons (`[radio]`) instead.
