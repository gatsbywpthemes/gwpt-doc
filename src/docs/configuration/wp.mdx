Your WordPress website provides the content for your Gatsby website, but it also provides some configuration. Let's list what you can configure via WordPress Customiser.

## Settings for your Gatsby Website

> The Gatsby configuration via WordPress is only available for sites that use our Headless WP parent theme together with the starter-specific child theme. Please note that some settings may be unavailable if you use a different theme.

### Site Identity

- Site title
- Site tagline
- Site logo
- Dark version of the logo (if your starter supports dark theme)
- Site icon

### General Features

- **Add WordPress Comments** - whether they should or should not be activated. This feature is activated by default.  
  The comments are displayed for posts that have comments status set to "Allow Comments."
  Commenting on your Gatsby site works similar to commenting on your WordPress site.
  The main difference is that **we only support two levels of comments nesting.**  
   Under the hood, comments are fetched from WordPress and updated on WordPress (and re-fetched if necessary) with Apollo Client.
  Consequently, some of your WordPress Discussion settings apply to your Gatsby comments, see [WordPress Core Settings > Discussion](http://localhost:8000/configuration/wp-core#settings--discussion).
- **Add WordPress Search** - whether native WordPress search should be activated. It's deactivated by default.
- ** Add Color Modes ** (if relevant) - whether switching color modes should be activated. It is activated by default for starters related to Gatsby themes that support color modes.

### Social Follow Links

- **Ordered list of links to your social profiles** that will be displayed in the Social Follows widget.

The supported profiles are Behance, Codepen, Dev, Discord, Dribbble, Facebook, Github, GitLab, Instagram, Linkedin, Mastodon, Medium, Pinterest, Reddit, Slack, Slideshare, Snapchat, Soundcloud, StackOverflow, Telegram, Tumblr, Twitter, Vimeo, Youtube.

### Gatsby Widgets

Our Gatsby themes do not provide support for native WordPress widgets. Instead, we provide our Gatsby widgets that have similar functionalities to their WordPress counterparts:

- Social Follow
- Recent Posts
- Categories
- Tags
- Newsletter

## Gatsby Colors Theme

Depending on the starter, you might have the possibility to set up the Gatsby Colors Theme via WordPress Customizer. If you prefer to define colors in your `.js` configuration file instead, please head to the [Colors Configuration section.](/configuration/colors/#setting-colors-in-js-configuration-file)
